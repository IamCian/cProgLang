/*
	Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input
	are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
	===

	One could test the program by giving it different character inputs of decent
	length, to see if the program counts everything. Hyphenated words would cause
	an issue as they would be counted as one, since they are not separated by
	whitespace.
