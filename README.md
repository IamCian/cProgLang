# The C Programming Language (2nd edition) exercises

'The C Programming Language' (Kernighan, Ritchie 1988) book contains many
exercises to practically teach the language to the reader. I read the book in
the little spare time I had in secondary school, a few years back. Though it
was a brilliant read, I had no computer with me to do the exercises. I am now
re-reading it, and doing the exercises.
